### Current Architecture
1. **Frontend (`src/App.tsx`)**: Professional real estate content creator interface with responsive design
2. **Backend (`handlers/video.go`)**: 
   - Existing video generation endpoints: FFmpeg-based (free) and Google Veo (paid)
   - **NEW**: 3 realtor workflow routes with WebSocket streaming
   - **NEW**: Concurrent image analysis using Google Gemini Vision API
   - **NEW**: Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
   - N8N webhook integration for AI content composition (legacy)
   - Structured video composition schema (`backend/schema/video_composition.json`)
   - Background music library and TTS integration

### Current Workflow (Realtor Platform)
1. **Session Initiation**: POST `/api/realtor/initiate` → returns session ID & WebSocket URL
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Client connects to `/api/realtor-ws?session={id}` for real-time updates
3. **Property Upload**: Realtor uploads property data + photos via WebSocket
4. **Concurrent AI Analysis**: 5-worker pool analyzes images simultaneously with Gemini Vision
5. **Progress Streaming**: Real-time updates (10% → 70% → 100%) streamed to client
6. **Schema Generation**: Final property video schema created from all analyses
7. **Video Generation**: Existing FFmpeg/Veo pipeline creates final video
8. **Cancellation Support**: DELETE `/api/realtor/cancel/{sessionId}` for cleanup

## Streaming Architecture Implementation

### Concurrent Processing Structure
```
WebSocket Handler (processRealtorUpload)
├── Progress Streamer (dedicated goroutine)
│   └── Real-time WebSocket updates to client
├── Image Analysis Worker Pool (5 concurrent workers)
│   ├── Worker 1: Gemini Vision API → room detection, features
│   ├── Worker 2: Gemini Vision API → lighting, composition scoring  
│   ├── Worker 3: Gemini Vision API → marketing appeal assessment
│   ├── Worker 4: Gemini Vision API → concurrent analysis
│   └── Worker 5: Gemini Vision API → concurrent analysis
├── Results Aggregator (collectResultsAndGenerateSchema)
│   └── Final property schema generation
└── Session Management (cleanup, cancellation support)
```

### Channel Architecture
```go
imageQueue chan ImageAnalysisTask (buffered by photo count)
    ↓
5 Concurrent Gemini Vision Workers
    ↓
resultsQueue chan ImageAnalysisResult (buffered)
    ↓
Results Aggregator → Property Schema Generation
    ↓
progressQueue chan ProgressUpdate (100 capacity buffer)
    ↓
WebSocket Progress Streamer → Real-time Client Updates
```

### AI Analysis Pipeline
**Per Image Analysis (concurrent):**
- **Room Classification**: kitchen, living_room, bedroom, bathroom, exterior, etc.
- **Feature Detection**: granite counters, hardwood floors, stainless appliances, etc.
- **Quality Assessment**: lighting quality (poor→excellent), composition score (1-10)
- **Marketing Value**: appeal rating (low→exceptional)
- **Description Generation**: Marketing-focused room descriptions

**Aggregated Schema Generation:**
- **Optimal Sequencing**: Room priority + marketing appeal scoring
- **Marketing Highlights**: Unique features across all photos
- **Tour Narrative**: Hook + room segments + call-to-action
- **Voice Recommendations**: Style based on property type/price
- **Timing Distribution**: Per-photo duration for video flow

### WebSocket Message Types
```javascript
// Progress Updates
{type: "status", progress: 45, message: "Completed 3/7 photo analyses"}

// Individual Photo Completion
{type: "status", message: "Analyzed kitchen.jpg", data: {completed_image: 2}}

// Final Results
{type: "detailed_update", status: "complete", data: {
  property_data: {address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, features},
  image_analyses: [{room_type, features, description, marketing_appeal}],
  video_schema: {metadata, narrative, photo_sequence, timing},
  successful_analyses: 7
}}

// Error Handling
{type: "status", status: "warning", message: "Some analyses failed: bedroom2.jpg"}
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Concurrent Processing**: 5 images analyzed simultaneously
- **Rate Limit Aware**: Worker count optimized for Gemini API limits
- **Error Resilient**: Individual failures don't stop processing
- **Progress Streaming**: Real-time feedback (10% → 100%)
- **Memory Efficient**: Buffered channels prevent goroutine blocking
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic resource management and cancellation
